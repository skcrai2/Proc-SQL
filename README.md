# Proc-SQL
Using SAS to run proc sql

The SQL procedure is the Base SAS implementation of Structured Query 
Language. PROC SQL is part of Base SAS software, and you can use it with any SAS 
data set (table). Often, PROC SQL can be an alternative to other SAS procedures 
or the DATA step. You can use SAS language elements such as global statements, 
data set options, functions, informats, and formats with PROC SQL just as you can 
with other SAS procedures. PROC SQL can:

• generate reports 
• generate summary statistics 
• retrieve data from tables or views 
• combine data from tables or views 
• create tables, views, and indexes 
• update the data values in PROC SQL tables 
• update and retrieve data from database management system (DBMS) 
tables 
• modify a PROC SQL table by adding, modifying, or dropping columns. 

PROC SQL can be used in an interactive SAS session or within batch programs, 
and it can include global statements, such as TITLE and OPTIONS.
